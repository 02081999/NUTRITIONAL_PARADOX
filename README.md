🌍 Global Nutrition Insights: Obesity & Malnutrition Trends Analysis

A data-driven exploration of the global paradox: rising obesity and persistent undernutrition.



📘 Project Overview

This project investigates the complex global health challenge of overnutrition (obesity) and undernutrition (malnutrition) using publicly available data from the World Health Organization (WHO).

As a Data Analyst at a global health organization, the goal is to:

Understand how nutritional disparities vary across countries, regions, age groups, and genders.

Identify trends, patterns, and outliers.

Derive actionable insights to help inform global health strategies.

📊 Key Objectives

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on cleaned WHO obesity and malnutrition datasets.

Compare obesity vs malnutrition across demographic groups.

Visualize trends over time and identify regions or countries with dual burdens.

Detect data uncertainties through confidence interval analysis.

Share insights that highlight critical areas of concern and opportunity.
